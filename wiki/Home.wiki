== bagedit ==
This is a small collection of scripts to manage ROS bag files. For now you can only find the bagtrim.py script. Another script to merge logfiles will follow.

=== Getting started ===
* Checkout the bagedit node to a local ROS Stack:
{{{
#!bash
hg clone https://daniel_dube@bitbucket.org/daniel_dube/bagedit
}}}

* Setup your ROS environment. On Ubuntu with a ordinary ROS Diamondback installation, the following commands will do it:
{{{
#!bash
source /opt/ros/diamondback/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=`pwd`:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
}}}

* Run the script:
{{{
#!bash
rosrun bagedit bagtrim.py --help
}}}

=== bagedit ===
{{{
#!bash
